now this is a script of a sequencer that works perfectly.It has been tried and tested. Learn how we were able to get the abis, load the contract and were able to do the connections and configure the parameters. They are the same configurations dont change anything. Only this time we want to do a new work involving  a BCADN contract. You will only show a new way of testing the parameers, build the abi inside the work and then provide results, and test the interractions and provide detailed results that can be logged as images as visualization. I will give you the smart contracts. You will keep the configuration, remove any test related to sequencers and replace with BCADN Test ideas while making sure it is logged. Please dont remove anything that does not need removing. This script works and is well tested. Thanks. The script is here: Now the BCADN contract
